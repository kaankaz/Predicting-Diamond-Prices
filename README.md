# Predicting-Diamond-Prices
Predicting Diamond Prices using data cleaning, feature engineering and various regression algorithms.

This project aims to optimize diamond market price predictions using diverse supervised machine learning techniques, resulting in an 8% average reduction in validation error, thereby improving investment and retail decisions in the diamond industry

• Employed machine learning techniques to predict the market price of diamonds, with different regression/tree- based models: linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, bagging, decision tree, random forest, and extra trees.
• Used cross-validation to validate the results, as well as forward/backward feature selection and hyper- parameter tuning to optimize the performance of models–particularly k-nearest neighbors, extra trees, bagging, and stacking regressor–and on average reduced the validation error by 8%.
